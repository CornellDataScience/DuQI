Objective: To create a system capable of detecting duplicate questions on 
Q&A platforms.

We expect our approach to help centralize the available knowledge on a single
question/issue and direct users with questions that have already been answered
to the appropriate resource.

We will test a variety of duplicate question identification methods on the 
[Quora question pairs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs/data),
and hope to eventually apply our findings to the classroom Q&A platform Piazza to
improve the Cornell student experience.
